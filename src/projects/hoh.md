**Heroes of Hammerwatch** is a rogue-lite, action-adventure RPG known for its near-infinite replayability thanks to its incremental New Game Plus (NG+) system. However, as players progress to higher NG+ levels, success becomes heavily reliant on luck—specifically, in receiving favorable random **Bloodrites** and **Imp Rewards**, which are critical for scaling characters to survive tougher challenges.

**The problem?** This randomness can severely bottleneck progression and frustrate players aiming for long-term success.

**The solution?** I developed two mods:

* **Choose Your Bloodrites**
* **Choose Imp Rewards**

These mods replace the luck-based system with player choice, allowing users to select from the full pool of Bloodrites and Imp Rewards rather than receiving a random one. This empowers players to strategically scale their characters and tackle higher NG+ levels more reliably.

In addition, I created the **Enhanced Tooltips** mod to provide clearer, more informative in-game descriptions—another improvement for player experience.

All three mods were developed using **AngelScript**, an open-source, compiled scripting language similar to C++. Together, these mods have accumulated over **8,500 active subscribers** and are featured among the **top 20 most-subscribed mods** for the game.
